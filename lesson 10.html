<h2>Reading and Writing to Files</h2>
<h3>Reading Files</h3>
<p>The simplest way to work with files is through java.io.File class, which must be imported before you can use it. This class can be used to open files of the given</p>

<h2>Additional information about Streams</h2>
<h3>OutputStream and System.out</h3>
<p>An <em>OutputStream</em> is a class that supports output-- to a screen, file, or elsewhere. OutputStream provides several overloaded methods for writing a sequence of bytes to a destination. That sequence is normally placed into a buffer, and the system then outputs the buffer at various times.</p>
<p><em>System.out</em> is a predefined output stream object that is associated with a system's standard output, usually a computer screen. That System class' out variable is a reference derived from OutputStream called <em>PrintStream</em> (e.g., <code>PrintStream out;</code> in the System class). The PrintStream class extends the base functionality of the OutputStream class and provides the print() and println() methods for converting different types of data into a sequence of characters (strings).</p>
<p>The print() and println() methods are overloaded in order to support the various standard data types, such as int, boolean, float, etc., each method converting that data type to a sequence of characters. Basic use of these methods and System.out was discussed in an earlier lesson.</p>
<p>The print() and println() methods also provide support for reference types. When a programmer invokes either printing method with an argument of a reference type, the method prints a string representation of the object. This string representation consists of the name of the object's class followed by the "@" character and the hexadecimal value of the object's hash code. A hash code typically represents the object's address in memory, although this is not guaranteed by the Java specification.</p>
<p>Note that because the System class is predefined, a programmer is not required to import the System class in order to use the output stream System.out.</p>

<h3>InputStream and System.in</h3>
<p>Programs need to receive input data, from a keyboard, touchscreen, or elsewhere. An InputStream is a class for achieving such input. InputStream provides several overloaded read() methods that all0ow a programmer to extract bytes from a particular source.</p>
<p><em>System.in</em> is a predefined input stream object reference that is associated with a system's standard input, which is usually a keyboard. A programmer is not required to import the System class in order to use System.in because the System class is a predefined class.</p>
<p>The System.in input stream automatically reads the standard input from a memory region, known as a buffer, that the operating system fills with the input data.</p>
<p>System.in is an input byte stream, and thus the read() method reads the first 8-bit ASCII value available from the operating system's buffer. Each 8-bit value read from the input stream is returned as an int (instead of byte) in order to allow the programmer to determine if data is no longer available, which is indicated by a return value of -1.</p>
<p>When using an InputStream, a programmer must append the clause <code>throws IOException</code> to the definition of main() (or whatever method the InputStream is being used in) or use a try/catch. A program can throw an IOException when it encounters certain errors as it is trying to read from an input stream.</p>
<p>As seen from previous examples, a programmer often needs a way to extract strings or integers from an input stream. Instead of directly reading bytes from System.in, a program typically uses the Scanner class as a wrapper that augments System.in by automatically scanning a sequence of bytes and converting those bytes to the desired data type. To initialize a Scanner object, a programmer can pass an InputStream, such as System.in, as an argument to the constructor as in <code>Scanner scnr = new Scanner(System.in);</code>. Basic use of the Scanner object was discussed in earlier lessons.</p>

<h3>Streams Using Strings</h3>
<p>Sometimes a programmer wishes to read input data from a string rather than from the keyboard (standard input). A programmer can associate a Scanner object with a String rather than with the keyboard (standard input). Such an object can be used just like a Scanner object associated with the System.in stream. A Scanner object initialized from a String is often referred to as an input string stream.</p>
<p>The program uses import java.util.Scanner; for access to the Scanner class. The statement Scanner scnr = new Scanner(userInfo); creates a Scanner object in which the associated input stream is initialized with a copy of userInfo. Then, the program can extract data from the scanner inSS using the family of next() methods (e.g., next(), nextInt(), nextDouble(), etc.).</p>
<p>The program uses scnr.nextLine() to read an input line from the standard input and copy the line into a String. The statement <code>scnr = new Scanner(lineString);</code> uses the Scanner's constructor to initialize the stream's buffer to the String lineString. Afterwards, the program extracts input from that stream using the next() methods.</p>
<p>Similarly, a new output string stream can be created that is associated with a string rather than with the screen (standard output). An output string stream is created using both the StringWriter and PrintWriter classes, which are available by including: <code>import java.io.StringWriter;</code> and <code>import java.io.PrintWriter;</code></p>
<p>The StringWriter class provides a character stream that allows a programmer to output characters. The PrintWriter class is a wrapper class that augments character streams, such as StringWriter, with print() and println() methods that allow a programmer to output various data types (e.g., int, double, String, etc.) to the underlying character stream in a manner similar to System.out.</p>
<p>To create a PrintWriter object, the program must first create a StringWriter, passing the StringWriter object to the constructor for the PrintWriter. Once the PrintWriter object is created, a program can insert characters into that stream using print() and println(). The program can then use the StringWriter's toString() method to copy that buffer to a String.</p>
<p>Notice that the PrintWriter object provides the print() and println() methods for writing to the stream, and the StringWriter object provides the toString() method for getting the resulting String.<del> The following example illustrates the use of StringWriter and PrintWriter classes.<del></del></del></p>
